      <p>At Fulton Mind Matters, we understand how important mental health is. Taking care of your mental health and having access to resources when you need it is essential.</p>

      <p>With the stresses of daily life, mental health issues like depression, anxiety, addiction, and trauma are extremely common. However, mental health is still deeply misunderstood, underfunded, and stigmatized in our society.</p>

      <p>Our mission is to provide the Fulton County community with the mental health resources, education, and support systems they desperately need and deserve.</p>
